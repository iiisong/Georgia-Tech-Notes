  - Feathers evolved for thermal insulation and decor feathers for sexual selection


## Argument
> Humans are social animals, living in large groups. Pressured us into developing big brains to (a) control our own behavior and understand others' and (b) use language as the group cohesive

1. ### WE have big brains
    - not about absolute brain size
    - its abou relative size
      - brain wave x body weight (log log plot)
    - Human evolution increase brain size over time
      - 3 folds within 2 myr
    - costs associated with big brain
      - expensive to keep running
        - 25% of body weight
        - expected more gut mass for apes, exchanged gut mass for brain mass
            - weird gastricintestinal problems
      -  Risks during childbirth
      - altricial
         > meaning "requiring nourishment", refers to pattern of growth and development in organisms which are incapable of moving around on their own soon after hatching or being born
        - increased cost sustaining it
    - compromised locomotor efficiency (due to replacement)
      - trade-off: profit from increased "big-brain adaptability"
      - no hands for feets
    - psychological and social costs of being too clever by half
      - trade-off: benefits from the advantages of intelligence, consciousness, art, morality and creativity ... What are they?
    - sacrifice for sensory in exchange for prefrontal

2. ### This has to do with group size ("Machiavellian hypothesis", Robin Dunbar)
    - Neocortex
      > is a set of layers of cerebral cortex involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, motor commands, spatial resoning, and language
    - Neocortex ratio directly related with mean group size
      - neocortex ratio  = ratio of neocortex to rest of brain
    - Larger brain because living in larger larger groups
      - relations is combinations, grows rapidly
        - 3 people 3 connections
        - 4 people 6 connections
        - 5 people 24 connections  
        ...
    - Groups are good, decrease reisks of predators (deterrent, early detection, confusion during attack)
    - Problem: overcrowding
    - Solution: subgroups (alliances, coalitions)
    - Primate solution: **Grooming**
      - hygienic purpose
      - social purpose (form coalitions, reduce stress)
      - Grooming as **social cement**: endorphin production is crucial
        - endorphin levels higher in groomee after groomin
        - stop grooming when morphined
        - Become more irritable and show more need for groming after being given nalaxone (antagonizes endorphins)
      - grooming is costly
        - little chance of ree-riding
        - takes lotss of time
    - neocortex ration in human is 4.1 
      - rough expected group size is 150
      - Dunbar's Number
      - around 150 max ppl you really keep track of
    - if we roomed, 60% of time spent with our hands in someone's hair
      - language is more efficient
    - language as grooming
      - talk as grooming
      - distribute info
      -
