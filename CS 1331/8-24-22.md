# What is Java?

Developed for **embedded systems**.
> An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality.

Assembly language super tedious.

Computers are not smart, they are fast.

Java developed by Oracle to a high level language that can run on variety of devices that has decent security and not depependent on memory management.

### Internet late 80s-90s

Space Jam early "interactive" website

Interactive websites

**Web Apps**
Java programs can be embedded into webpages themselves

**Applets** laid the foundation for web applications. Create dynamic contents like games, stock tickers, animations, and more

Language evolved into general purpose programming language allow for apps written in desktop and animations

Android written in Java

# 2 Types of Languages
## Interpretative
When run code, run source code  
"**Interpreter** "reads" what to do  
No compiler  
1 step process, run.

Pros:
To distribute, just send source code  
Convenient

Cons:
People can copy source code spread it around  
Takes longer to run because of interpretation done every run cycle
  - performance loss extremely impactful when ran often

## Compiled 
Source code -> **Compiler** -> Machine Instruction* -(sometimes)-> Linker -> Executable File

Executable File / Machine Instruction -> run

*platform specific

2 step process, compile then run


## Java does both

### Compile time

Source code -> Java Compiler -> Java Bytecode (.class file)


### Runtime
Java Bytecode (.class file) -> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) / Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs it
