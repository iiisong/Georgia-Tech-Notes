## Dimension
> The d**dimension** of a non-zero subspace *H*, dim *H*, is the number of vectors in a basis of *H*, We define $dim\{0\} = 0$

Theorem
> Any two choices of basis $B_1$ and $B_2$ of a non-zero subspace $H$ have the same dimension. 

$dim \R^n = n$ bc {e1, e2, ..., en} form basis of $\R^n$

$H = \{(x_1, ..., x_n) : x_1 + ... +x_n = 0\}$, 1 pivot so n-1 free variables

dim(Null A) is the number of free variables of A

dim(Col A) is the number of pivots of A



## Coordinates
> LEt $B = \{\vec{b_1}, ..., \vec{b_p}\}$ be a basis for a subspace $H$. If $\vec{x}$ is in $H$, then coordinates of $\vec{x} relative $B$ are the weights (scalars) $c_1, ..., c_p$ so that 
$$ \vec{x} = c_1\vec{b_1} + ... + c_p\vec{b_p}$$
And 
$$[x]_b = 
c_1
...
c_p$$



Let v1 =
1
0
1

v2
1
1
1

x
5
3
5


Verify that x is in the span of B = {v1, v2} and calculate [x]_b


1 1 | 5
0 1 | 3
1 1 | 5



1 1 | 5
0 1 | 3
0 0 | 0

No pivot in last column, x is in span
