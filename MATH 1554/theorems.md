## **Theorem 4**
> Let $A$ be an $mxn$ matrix. Then the following statements are logically equivalent. That is, for a particular $A$, **either they are all true statements or they are all false**.  
> 
> a. For each **b** in $R^m$, the equation $Ax = b$ has a solution.  
b. Each **b** in $R^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$
c. The columns of $A$ span $R^m$  
d. *A* has a pivot position in every row.

### **Pivots in every row of reduced row eschelon form of A prevents pivots in B.**

## **Theorem 5**
> If $A$ is an $m x n$ matrix, $u$ and $v$ are vectors in $R^n$, and $c$ is a scalar, then:  
a. $A(u + v) = Au + Av$  
b. $A(cu) = c(Au)$
