# **Worksheet 1.3, Vector Equations**
**Worksheet Exercises**
1. **Written Explanation Exercise**

    a) What does the span of a set of vectors represent?

    b) How do we determine whether a vector is in the span of a set of vectors?

2. Suppose A = 
2 -1 3
4 -2 6

    a) Sketch the span of the columns of the matrix. *Remember to label your axes. Also, arrows should be use d for coordinate axes and vectors, because they are quantities with direction. But do not sketch the span of a set of vectors using arrows.*

    b) On the same graph, sketch vectors u = 
1
2

v = 
3
1

c) Using your graph, which of the following systems is consistent?

- $Ax = u$
- $Ax = v$

1. Span{$v_1,v_2$} isequal to which of the expressions below?  
    1. Span{$v_1, v_2, 3v_1$}
    2. Span{$v_1, 3v_1$}
    3. Span{$v_1, v_2, 3v_1 + 2v_2$}
2. For what values of $h$ is $\vec{b}$ in the plane spanned by $\vec{a_1}$ and $\vec{a_2}$?

$$
\vec{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix}
1\\[0.4em]
4\\[0.4em]
-1\\[0.4em]
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\vec{a_2} = \begin{pmatrix}
-6\\[0.4em]
-17\\[0.4em]
2\\[0.4em]
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\vec{b} =
\begin{pmatrix}
4\\[0.4em]
2\\[0.4em]
h\\[0.4em]
\end{pmatrix}
$$

3. Indicate whether the statements are true or false.
    1. If the equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ is inconsistent, then $\vec{b}$ is not in the set spanned by the columns of $A$.
    2. If the augmented matrix $\begin{bmatrix}
 A & \vec{b} \end{bmatrix}$  has a pivot position in every row, then the equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ must be consistent.
    3. There are exactly three vecors in Span{$\vec{a_1}, \vec{a_2},\vec{a_3}$}
