A. The goals for the assignment are teaching us the different aspect of communication, forcing us to self-reflect on our current status, and position of our current communication skills, and to use that to plan what we want to take out of the course by the end of this semester given the newly taught aspects of communications. For me, that would be "non-verbal communication." By splitting up communication into many modes, it led me to realize that my non-verbal skills could be improved and I aim to improve on it by the end of this semester.

C. The intended audience of my artifact is people in the class. Because none of the people in the class knew me previously, I need to put who I am in context for everyone else. However, as they are in the class and should know the assignment and "technical" terms used, I am free to use more "technical" acronyms that I wouldn't expect a person randomly chosen off the streets to know.

The piece of writing I am reviewing is my paper connecting themes of Asimov's novels to utilitarian concepts, how he resolves many of the issues in his futuristic societies, and how it applies to us. This was written as the final research project in my Science Fiction elective class I took in my senior year of high school last year. 

When you consider this work, what are you proud of in it? 
-
I am proud of the intensive background research I did for it and the overarching idea of the paper. The idea was a novel idea and the could be taken out-of-context of being purely Asimov and be applied to how we view life as a whole. It also is cool because the principles discussed in the paper could be applied in both a micro-scale, like how it can be applied someone's worldview, as well as a macro-scale, like how the philosophy can be applied to leading large groups of people past the levels of large countries.

What or How do you feel you did well in terms of composition, writing, etc?
-
I feel like the evidence I found were pretty solid. I also really enjoyed my use of connecting the different themes in Asimov's short stories to different concepts or problems of utilitarianism.  The formatting of my points tied to each other semi-coherently. I also enjoyed spending my first body paragraph setting the terms of philosophy, briefly going over the history and how I would interpret it in the paper.

<br>

What were the challenges you faced composing this work?
-
I remember getting the initial structure of the paper together was quite a challenge. I was unsure whether to include a seperate paragraph to set the terms of all the technical aspects of philosophy my paper was going to address. I also do not remember fondly the citation process of writing the essay. I formulated many of the ideas when reading evidences but didn't take as extensive notes on them so when I had to cite my work, I had to reread many of the long sources I used to match it to the correct evidences. Also, some of the sources I used had conflicting or impossible information so I had to carefully look over to identify which part I assumed is accurate. The "computational depth" argument I used, while is strong and a separate idea, doesn't have too much to clarify from. Grammar was also pain.

What seemed to be the main positive and negative feedback the instructor gave on your work? Your writing? How did they justify their grade?
-
Although I think I ened up with a decent grade on the paper. Like many of my previous essays or papers, the main criticism was my grammar. There were many sentences where my phrasings were less-than-ideal as well as places where I had inconsistent grammar. On the main content of my paper, I don't think the instructor had much issues with. I may also have had a point or two deducted for citational issues. I remember there also may have been a sentence or two that I did not elaborate enough for someone who has had no experience in Asimov or utilitarianism philosophy to understand.

<br>

Look back at your answers to all three previous sections of writing. How would you categorize them in the "Common Feedback Chart"? Why?
-
Grammar issues would be under Conventions  
Overall did pretty decent in Stance / Rhetorical Awareness  
Good connection of ideas with decent evidence supporting each point, Development of Ideas  
Extra paragraph contextualizing the terms of the essay is a combination of Organization and Development of Ideas  
Citational issues would probably be under the Design for Medium aspect or Conventions

Overall main strengths were in Stance / Rhetorical Awareness/ Organization / Development of Ideas

Weakenesses were in Conventions / Design for Medium

In other words, overall message was good, the technical execution of it? Less so.
