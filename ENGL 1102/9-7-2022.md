Inscription
What does the monument say about itself? If it's describing the eprson, event, or group, what etails does it choose to empahsize? 

Symbols
What are the symbolic elemtns? How are flowers, falgs, guns, swords, crosses, stars, or any item meant to inform our connection to the subject matter?

Imagery
Look at things like friezes, the layout and depiction fo the subject. How are they used (especially in design) to point towards a central "narrative"? A frieze depicting an event might be a part of larger story. How are those friezes "brought together." And what do they depict about the event or group in question?
