# Artifact 0 Script

Hi everyone, I’m Isaac and I’m a Computer Science major directly from Dallas, but originally from California who also spent a couple years overseas in Taiwan. I really enjoy trying out new hobbies, listening to music, and wearing funny. This video is for the Artifact 0 of the ENGL 1102 class taught by Dr Winter. I aim to come out of this class a stronger communicator. Out of all the modes in WOVEN (Written, Oral, Verbal, Electronic, or Non-Verbal Communication), the one I seek to hopefully get better at this semester would be “N,” “nonverbal communication. I have realized over the years that while I have had ample opportunities to directly practice each of the other modes, non-verbal communication is one aspect that I have often overlooked. When I communicate with others, I do tend to overfocus on the literal “content” of my message, which leads to me neglecting the “packaging” of the message. I hope that with a specific focus on non-verbal communication and more practice, I would not only be able to apply non-verbal communication better in my everyday life, but also read other's non-verbal communcation better.
