Hi everyone, I’m Isaac and I’m a Computer Science major directly from Dallas, but originally from California who also spent a couple years overseas in Taiwan. I really enjoy trying out new hobbies, listening to music, and bringing stupid ideas to life “because it is funny”. This video is for ENGL 1002 class taught by Dr Winter. Out of all the modes in WOVEN, the one I seek to hopefully get better at this semester would be “N,” “nonverbal communication. I have realized over the years that while I have had ample opportunities to directly practice each of the other modes, non-verbal communication is one aspect that often is overlooked. When I communicate with others, I do tend to overfocus on the literal “content” of my message, which leads to me neglecting the “packaging” of the message. I hope that with a specific focus on non-verbal communication and more practice, I would be able to apply many of the skills to any conversation I have.
