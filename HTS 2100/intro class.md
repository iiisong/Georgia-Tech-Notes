# HTS 2100 Class Intro

### Dr. Amit Prasad 

This course is about think at the limits, push to think harder, ask to be more creative.

Not about how much information you can remember, no sense remembering information rather than process information.

All the assignments will be take home and open-ended questions where you can write in so many different ways. How do you creatively play with it?
