# From gene action to reactive genomes

Genome is a reactive system. ncRNA aids in reaction. Genetic isn't something locked but dynamic and reactive system.
Shift from genetics as a static no inheritance of acquire characteristics to dynamic live dna. ncRNA act as regulator and mutator
Genome provides more than building and maintaining organism but also adapt and respond
Noncoding genes with diseases
We have long understood that organisms interact with their environments, that interactions between genetics and environment, between biology and culture, are crucial to making us what we are. What research in genomics shows is that, at every level, biology itself is constituted by those interaction. Nature vs nurture

At what point do we draw the line between epigenetics and genetics? What is genetics?


# Notes
- Epigenetic inheritance does not teach "change our genes"
    - Primay effect is to alter pattern of gene expression
- ## Epigenetics challenges distinction between "genetic" and "non-genetic"
    - What counts as epigenetic depends on what counts as genetics - Greisemer
- Weismannism
    - > no inheritance of acquired characterics
- Greisemer
    - >  reproduction is the multiplication of entities in such a way that the parts transferred to the off-spring confer on them the capacity to develop. And the capacity to develop is the capacity to acquire the capacity to reproduce. This is a recursive structure, and its recursiveness captures what I mean by saying that heredity and development are intertwined in reproduction processes.
    - > ‘Inheritance is a special case of reproduction processes’ and ‘Genetic inheritance is a special case of inheritance.’ Reproduction, life as we know it, requires some sort of inheritance system(s), but the transmission of genes is not itself a necessary prerequisite
- Keller
    - Inspired by more recent findings on molecular genomics
    - > Genome itself is a fundamentally reactive system, a sub-system of the cell composed of DNA that has been designed over the course of evolution to sense and to respond to the signals impinging on it.
    - Sequence of genome's DNA determines sensitivity and ability for outside signals
        - Changes in conformation
        - Choromatin remodelling
        Methylation of DNA
    - Title implies genes to genomes to from action to reaction
- Traditional knowledge wrong
    - Gene thought to be directly associated with a trait, and at the same time, a thing that could mutate and change
- Monod and Jacob
    - DNA made of genes, genes "acted" by making proteins
    - Regulator Genes
        - controls the rate of synthesis of proteins
        - structure of proteins governed by other genes
        - Regulation achieved through presense of regulator genes, repressing trasncription of orginal structural gene
    - Central Dogma remains: Genetic information located in protein-coding sequences, study of genetics still stdy of genes
- HGP shows genome is not the organism
    - Overwhelming majority of genenome noncoding DNA
    - Much less genes than expected. Actual between 20k - 25k from some estimated figures of over 100k  
    - human has similar gene count to other organisms
    - "junk" to "dark matter" perception of dna
- non coding RNA ncRNA are involved in many forms and levels of genomic regulation
- Strong correlation between chromatin marks and gene expression (mediated by ncRNA)
- High degree of connectivity between different regulatory systems found in model organisms studied (also mediated by ncRNA)
- large intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs)
    - operate across long distances, prove important to cell function
-ncRNA crucial to regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, chromosome dynamics, epigenetic memory,more
- ncRNA provides immensly rich resource for profusion of regulatory mechanism that enables gene expressions to respond to variabtion in both local and distal environmental context
    - provide means by which organisms can adapt to changing environments
- RNA seuqences are malleable, routinely rewritten and reinscribed
    - reverse transcription allows some changes to incorporated in DNA
        - Read/Write system - Shapiro
    
- ## The sophisticated mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated are quite sufficient to justify such a shift by themselves

- Genome provides more than building and maintaining organism but also adapt and respond
- Correlation between certain non-coding DNA and some disease
- Humans reactive at avery level
    - cultural, interpersonal, cellular, genetic
- > Similarly, if we understand the term environment
as including cultural dynamics, perhaps neither does
the division of biological from cultural factors.
- > Returning to Weismann’s view that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics is like ‘supposing that an English telegram to China is there received in the Chinese language’ (Weismann 1904, p. 63), I might suggest that a metaphor better fitting biological reality might even reverse the roles of sender and receiver, supposing a telegram sent from China that, if it was to be read, required its German readers to learn Chinese.
- > Genetics is not just about genes and what they code for. It is also about how the DNA sequences that give
rise to proteins are transcribed, spliced, and translated into amino acid sequences, in the appropriate amounts
at the appropriate time and place; about how these, once assembled into proteins, navigate or are transported to the sites where, and when, they are needed; etc, etc. All of this requires coordination of an order of complexity only now beginning to befully appreciated. It is also only now becoming evident that the ncRNA transcripts of the remaining 98–99% of the genome are central to this process.
- > The first job of the new genome is to detect the signals that impinge, and its second, to respond (e.g.
by change in its conformation) in ways that alter the patterns of gene expression.
