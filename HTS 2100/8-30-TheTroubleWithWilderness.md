### Unnaturalness of Naturalnes of Wilderness
- Wilderness **is** made of something profoundly unhuman
- Appreciation of wilderness is a cultural invention though
    - 250 years ago no appreciation for the "wilderness experience"
    - 18th century "wilderness" = "savage", "desolate", "barren"
        - not positive at all
        - instead of profound, the feeling is more alike to terror
    - Many of wilderness strongest word associations were biblical
        - Used accross KJV to describe margins of civilization
            - moralless and despaire
        - Moses wandered in wilderness for 40 years and worshiped golden idol
        - Christ struggled with temptations in wilderness
        - Milton's Eden surrounded by wilderness
    - Wilderness used to be a place one only came upon if forced
        - Only potential value of being "reclaimed" and "civilized"
- Post 19th century mindset change. Wilderness suddenly priceless

- Essay could be classified into 2 headings:
    1. ### Sublime
        - older than frontier
        - more perverse cultural construct
        - main fuel behind romanticism
    2. ### Frontier
        - More American, though with European parallels
    - Sublime and Frontier combines to define wilderness in new image
        - adds moral values and cultural symbols
- Modern environmentalism a branch of romanticism and post-frontierism

- Wilderness is sacred
    - Always existed
    - Even when an area of spiritual danger and moral temptation, there was also good
        - If Satan, also Christ
        - Early Christian saints emulate Christ's desert retreat in hopes of meeting God

## Sublime
- Sublime landscapes were rare places on earth where one had a chance to glimsp the face of God
    - Burke, Kant, Gilpin, and others
    - God could be everywhere but higher chance there
- 18th century catalog of sublime places didnt change
    - mountaintop, chasm, waterfall, thundercloud, rainbow, sunset
    - Similar to later American national parks
        - Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Rainier, Zion
- Less "sublime"  landscapes didnt get protected till much later
    - Everglades in 1940s
    - No national park still in grasslands
- Sublimity is marked by emotions it evoked
    - Early romantic writers did not describe the feeling as pleasurable
        - Wordsworth described it as terror
    - A religious experience
        - No mere mortal meant to linger in such a place
        - God is not something to be viewed at for long
    - By second half of 19th century, religious piety replaced with sentimentality
        - Much more "tamed"
        - "Sacred" more similar to a pleasurable parish church
        - Muir
    - Mountain as a cathedral
        - Wordsworth describes bewilderment
        - Thoreau describes loneliness
